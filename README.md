# vimprefs
This is a collection of preferences for Vim. Anyone can use them but they're tuned to the way I like 'em.

included plugins: sudoedit, sparkup, and a bunch of filetype support

color scheme is my own, based on Bohdan Vlasyuk's 'black' that shipped with Vim 7.something

***this has UNIX line endings. This can be used with Windows but you'd probably need to change the line endings***
